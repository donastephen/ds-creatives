1) Creating copy of object using clone
2) Class constants, which can be accessed using :: from other classes
3) Static methods and variables,  can be accessed from other classes using ::
4) Visibility of class methods and properties using private, public an protected
5) creating constructs using __construct and __destruct , earlier constructors where with same name as class name
6) Abstract classes- classes used as a model to define other classes.
	If a certain class contains abstract method, it must be defined as abstract.
7) Interfaces - which can help you design an API.
   All methods which are defined in an interface must be public and must be implemented
   In a class you can implement any number of interfaces.
8) Magic Methods - methods starting with __ and those are defined to provide additional functionality to classes.
   eg: __set,__get,__toString, __call
9) Finality - final methods cannot be implemented again and final classes to prevent it from having a children (you cannot extend it)

10) __autoload - helps in avoiding includes in the top of files and loads the file when PHP encounters undefined yet class

11) Type Hinting - u can specify which type of argument is expected as function argument it works only for objects and arrays not strings and integers
12) Exceptions - The exceptions are basically just objects. When an error occurs you can use an exception in its place. This way, when an exception is used, the rest of the following PHP code will not be executed

__call - gets called when invoking inaccessible methods in object context . Like accessing a method which is not even defined
        eg: __call($name, $arguments)  , $name - nam eof method and argument- argument the method is called with
__callStatic - gets called when invoking an inaccessible static method in


WEB SERVICE
Web services are way to access some data from server system by client system . They are machine independent, language independent.
For SOAP client requires WSDL from server or UDDI(Universal  Description discovery and Integration) to access the function
In case of REST client and server can communicate with URI
Both use HTTP as a medium of communication. REST uses HTTP methods GET,POST,PUT and DELETE.
