Indexes are the quick references for fast data retrieval of data from a database. There are two different kinds of indexes.

Clustered Index-
Only one per table
Faster to read than non clustered as data is physically stored in index order.
primary key
NonÂ­clustered Index-
Can be used many times per table.
Quicker for insert and update operations than a clustered index.
unique key
