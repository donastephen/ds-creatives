			ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set). It defines 127 different alphanumeric characters that could be used on the internet.<br/>ASCII supported numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .<br/>
			ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. It supported 256 different character codes.<br/>
			ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. It also supported 256 different character codes.<br/>
			Because ANSI and ISO were limited, the default character encoding was changed to UTF-8 in HTML5.<br/>

			The HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).

			However, the &lt;canvas&gt; element has no drawing abilities of its own (it is only a container for graphics) - you must use a script to actually draw the graphics. <br/>

			The getContext() method returns an object that provides methods and properties for drawing on the canvas.

			This reference will cover the properties and methods of the getContext("2d") object, which can be used to draw text, lines, boxes, circles, and more - on the canvas.
